# FootballSimulationEngine
Toy Markov Jump process model where I simulate the results of football matches using an MJP with rates given by the average goals per game in previous meetings between the home and away team.

Very much in its nascent stage, I list low-hanging improvements in the Jupyter notebooks that I hope to implement as time permits.
